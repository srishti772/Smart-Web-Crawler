# Instructions for Running the Web Crawler Project

This document provides the instructions needed to set up and run the Web Crawler project, which consists of a React front-end and a Spring Boot back-end.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Java JDK 11 or later
- Node.js 14.x or later
- Maven 3.6 or later
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Getting the Code
download the ZIP file of the project from the repository and unzip it.

## Setting Up the Back-End (Spring Boot)

1. Navigate to the `Webcrawler/back-end` directory:
   ```
   cd Webcrawler/back-end
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the Spring Boot application:
   ```
   ./mvnw clean spring-boot:run
   ```

This will start the back-end server on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Setting Up the Front-End (React)

1. Navigate to the `Webcrawler/front-end` directory:
   ```
   cd Webcrawler/front-end
   ```

2. Install the necessary Node modules:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

This will start the front-end and usually opens `http://localhost:3000` in your default web browser automatically. If not, you can manually open the URL in your browser.

## Using the Application
Once both the front-end and back-end are running, you can interact with the application through the React front-end interface.
